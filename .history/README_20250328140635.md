# OOTD - AI Fashion Stylist

This application helps users get personalized outfit recommendations based on their style preferences, religion, occasion, and other factors.

## Setting Up Image Generation

The application uses the Hugging Face Inference API to generate outfit images based on the AI recommendations. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Create a Hugging Face Account

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and create a free account
2. Verify your email address

### 2. Generate an API Token

1. Visit your [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click on "New token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "OOTD Image Generation")
4. Set the role to "Read"
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token - you'll need it for the next step

### 3. Configure your .env.local file

Add your Hugging Face API token to the `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```
HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 4. Start the application

Now when you run the application, the "Generate Outfit Images" button will use the Hugging Face API to generate outfit images based on your AI recommendations.
