# OOTD - AI Fashion Stylist

This application helps users get personalized outfit recommendations based on their style preferences, religion, occasion, and other factors.

## Setting Up Image Generation

The application uses the Hugging Face Inference API to generate outfit images based on the AI recommendations. Follow these steps to set it up:

### 1. Create a Hugging Face Account

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and create a free account
2. Verify your email address

### 2. Generate an API Token

1. Visit your [Hugging Face account settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click on "New token"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "OOTD Image Generation")
4. Set the role to "Read"
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token - you'll need it for the next step

### 3. Configure your Application (Choose one method)

#### Method 1: Using .env.local (Recommended)

Add your Hugging Face API token to the `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```
HF_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

Then restart your application completely.

#### Method 2: Using next.config.js

If Method 1 doesn't work, edit `next.config.js` and ensure it has:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  env: {
    HF_API_TOKEN: "your_token_here",
  },
  // ... other config
};
```

Then restart your application completely.

#### Method 3: Direct Configuration (Last Resort)

If neither of the above methods work:

1. Open `lib/config.ts`
2. Uncomment the line with `huggingFaceApiToken`
3. Replace `'hf_your_token_here'` with your actual token
4. Save the file and restart the application

### 4. Test If It's Working

After setting up, visit `/api/test-env` in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000/api/test-env). You should see:
```json
{
  "hasToken": true,
  "tokenPreview": "hf_xx" // First few characters of your token
}
```

### 5. Start the application

Now when you run the application, the "Generate Outfit Images" button will use the Hugging Face API to generate outfit images based on your AI recommendations.
